	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a concept in computer science that measures the efficient of an algorithm by examining how its execution time changes with input size. It is often expressed using big-O notation, providing an upper bound on the algorithm's worst-case running time. This analysis helps developers make informed choices about algorithm selection and understand performance trade-offs in software development.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> ( O(n) ) in computer science assesses how much memory an algorithm needs relative to its input size. It helps developers understand how an algorithm's memory requirements scale, aiding in the selection of efficient algorithms and making informed decisions about memory usage in software development.</p>
